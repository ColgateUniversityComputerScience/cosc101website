title: COSC 101&#58; Final Exam
---


The final exam is two hours long. The exam will be similar in format to the previous exams.  You will take the final exam 
at the [time assigned to your section by the Registrar](https://www.colgate.edu/about/campus-services-and-resources/final-exam-schedule)

## Concepts covered

The final exam is *cumulative* and encompasses all topics covered by earlier exams.

The *new* concepts since the last exam include:

  - dictionaries
  - use of data structures (lists, dictionaries) to solve different types of problems
  - recursion (if covered by your section; does not apply to Section A)
  - machine learning (Section A only)

These new concepts will be emphasized on the final.

## Study tips

- **Do practice problems.**
- Write out your answer on paper (computers are not permitted during the exam!)
- Avoid looking at the solutions until you've spent at least 15-30 minutes trying to write the solution on your own.
- Try to talk through your code with a friend.  Don't just say "here's a while loop"; instead, explain what the code is trying to do.  The more you can talk through your approach to a problem, the easier it will be to write code that implements that approach.

## Study materials

- Problems from class (slides, handouts, quizzes, etc.)
- Problems from each section read from the textbook
- [Random expression generator](https://www.cs.colgate.edu/~jsommers/cgi-bin/cosc101expr.php)
- Practice problems from the previous exams ([exam 1](../exam1), [exam 2](../exam2), and [exam 3](../exam3))
- Additional practice [problems](practice_problems) and [solutions](practice_solutions) 
- Previous final exams

**Note:** the additional practice problems and previous final exams include questions about recursion and tuples, which may or may not have been covered by your section. If your section did not cover these topics, they will not appear on your final exam.
