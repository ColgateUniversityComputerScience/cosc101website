title: COSC 101&#58; Exam 1
---


## Concepts covered

The first exam covers the following topics:

- Types (`int`, `str`, `float`, `bool`)
- Expressions, variables, and assignment
- Interactive programs (`input`, `print`)
- Modules (`import`, `random`, `math`, `turtle`)
- Conditional statements (`if`/`elif`/`else`)
- Repetition with definite loops (`for`)
- Accumulator patterns


## Study tips

- **Do practice problems.**
- Write out your answer on paper (computers are not permitted during the exam!)
- Avoid looking at the solutions until you've spent at least 15-30 minutes trying to write the solution on your own.


## Practice exams

Note that these practice exams from previous semesters did not always cover the same topics as we have covered this fall. 
Specifically, some do not include for loops or accumulator patterns, while some do include functions. 
You should feel free to skip problems involving topics that are not in the above list.
