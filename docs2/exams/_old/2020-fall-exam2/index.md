title: COSC 101&#58; Exam 2
---

## Concepts covered

The second exam covers up through file input/output and exceptions.  See your course schedule for textbook sections that have been covered. The exam is *cumulative*.

The *new* concepts since the last exam include:

- variable scope (in the context of functions)
- strings 
- nested for loops
- while loops
- lists
- text file input/output

## Study tips

- **Do practice problems.**
- Write out your answer on paper (computers are not permitted during the exam!) Once you have an answer, test it by tracing your code by hand. Then you may find it useful to type it into a computer and run it in IDLE or Python Tutor's Visualize.
- Avoid looking at the solutions until you've spent at least 15-30 minutes trying to solve the problem on your own.


## Study materials

- Problems from class (slides, handouts, etc.)
- Exercises from readings
- [Practice Exam](practice_exam2_blank.pdf)
- [Practice Exam Solutions](practice_exam2_solutions.pdf)
- [Practice Problems](practice_problems)
- [Practice Problem Solutions](practice_solutions)
- [More Practice Problems](more_practice_problems)
- [More Practice Problem Solutions](more_practice_solutions)

Note that each item above (practice exam, practice problem set 1, and practice problem set 2) does not individually cover _all_ the concepts that are relevant for this exam, but the collection of problems does.

Besides the problems above, you can also get additional practice with Python expressions with this [expression generator](https://www.cs.colgate.edu/~jsommers/cgi-bin/cosc101expr.php?int=0&float=0&bool=0&str=0&list=0) web page.

Moreover, there are additional practice problems available online at [Coding Bat](https://codingbat.com/python) and [CodeCheck](https://horstmann.com/codecheck/python-questions.html).
