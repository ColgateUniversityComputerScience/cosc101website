<li>(OPTIONAL) Do the challenge problem for this assignment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that each starter <code>.py</code> file has a header with some information for you to fill in. Please do so. Your feedback helps the instructors to better understand your experiences doing the homeworks and where we can provide better assistance.</p>
<h2 id="program-1-income-taxes">Program 1: Income Taxes</h2>
<p>In the <code>hw3_taxes.py</code> file, write a program that calculates how much a user owes in federal income taxes. The program should ask a user for their gross income and total deductions (in dollars) and output how much the user owes in taxes.</p>
<p>Your program should use the 2019 Single Tax Bracket:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Rate</th>
<th>Taxable Income Bracket*</th>
<th>Tax Owed</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>10%</td>
<td>$0 to $9,700</td>
<td>10% of taxable income</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>12%</td>
<td>$9,701 to $39,475</td>
<td>$970 plus 12% of the excess over $9,700</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>22%</td>
<td>$39,476 to $84,200</td>
<td>$4,543 plus 22% of the excess over $39,475</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>24%</td>
<td>$84,201 to $160,725</td>
<td>$14,382 plus 24% of the excess over $84,200</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>32%</td>
<td>$160,726 to $204,100</td>
<td>$32,748 plus 32% of the excess over $160,725</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>35%</td>
<td>$204,101 to $510,300</td>
<td>$46,628 plus 35% of the excess over $204,100</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>37%</td>
<td>$510,301+</td>
<td>$153,798 plus 37% of the excess over $510,300</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>*Taxable income is gross income minus deductions.</p>
<p>The output of your program should look like this (<code>98765</code> and <code>12200</code> are the inputs entered by the user):</p>
<pre><code>What is your gross income? 98765
What is your total deduction? 12200
Your taxable income is $86565
You owe $14949.6 in federal taxes</code></pre>
<p>This <a href="https://www.taxact.com/tools/tax-bracket-calculator">online tax calculator</a> can help you verify your program works correctly (again, note that the above brackets are valid for the 2019 US tax year).</p>
<h2 id="problem-2-day-of-the-year">Problem 2: Day of the year</h2>
<p>In the <code>hw3_doy.py</code> file, write a program that asks the user for a day of the year and prints the corresponding month and day of the month. If a user enters a number that is too small or too large, your program should print <code>Enter a positive integer</code> or <code>There are only 365 days in a year</code>, respectively. Your program should be designed for <em>non-leap years</em>.</p>
<p>The output of your program should be like this (<code>46</code> is the input entered by the user):</p>
<pre><code>Enter the day of the year: 46
Day 46 is February 15</code></pre>
<p>Here is another example (<code>400</code> is the input entered by the user):</p>
<pre><code>Enter the day of the year: 400
There are only 365 days in a year</code></pre>
<p>Your program’s output should match the above exactly. Remember to test your code to make sure it works with different inputs; don’t forget about boundary cases!</p>
<h2 id="problem-3-adventure">Problem 3: Adventure</h2>
<p>In the <code>hw3_adventure.py</code> file, you should create a Python program that is a work of interactive fiction, a.k.a., a choose-your-own-adventure program. The starter code in <code>hw3_adventure.py</code> provides the start of an adventure that you may continue or replace with your own story. Your finished program needs to include <em>at least 5</em> <code>if</code>-based control structures that affect the story or dialog (more details below). Your program should also ask for input() from the user as many times as needed.</p>
<p>Here are the control structures to be sure to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An if, elif, and else control structure (with exactly one elif)</li>
<li>An if, elif, elif, … and else control structure (with at least two elifs)</li>
<li>An if, else control structure (with zero elifs)</li>
<li>An if, elif, … control structure (with one or more elifs but no trailing else at all)</li>
<li>An if control structure (with no trailing elif nor trailing else at all)</li>
</ul>
<p>Your <code>if</code> statements do <em>not</em> need to appear in the above order, and you’re welcome to add more than this, if you wish!</p>
<p>Please keep things light, and please be mindful of the time you spend on this problem. The goal here is <em>not</em> to take a lot of time.</p>
<p>Happy adventuring!</p>
<h1 id="testing">Testing</h1>
<p>For this homework, we are providing a program that you can use to test that your homework is meeting the basic specifications of the assignment.</p>
<p>Please note:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The test program is <strong>extremely</strong> picky about spacing in the output (from print statements) your program produces. If it reports an error, it might just be the difference of a single space.</p></li>
<li><p>The test program is <strong>NOT</strong> a complete test. You will still need to take responsibility for thoroughly testing your code before submitting. However, our hope is that this test program will at least catch minor errors and make it easier for our grading process and more likely for you to receive full credit.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To use the test program, follow these steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Find the test program that is inside the zip file for this homework. The file name is <code>hw3tester.py</code>. Make sure that this file is in <em>exactly</em> the same folder as the homework files for this assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure your homework files are named exactly as described in assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>Open <code>hw3tester.py</code> in IDLE.</p></li>
<li><p>In IDLE, select <code>Run</code> -&gt; <code>Run module</code></p></li>
<li><p>Read the test messages that are printed and revise your work accordingly. If the output of your program does not precisely match the expected output, a test will fail. An HTML file (a web page) will be created to show the exact differences between what your program prints and the expected output; if output does not match, you will see a message such as <code>View a detailed output comparison in hw3_taxes.py.html.</code> indicating the name of the file that you can open in your web browser.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We hope you find this helpful!</p>
<h1 id="grading">Grading</h1>
<p>Your assignment will be graded on two criteria:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Correctness: this document contains details for how you must complete each program, including examples. Be sure that you run your program once for each example and make sure it works correctly for each one, and use the <code>hw3tester.py</code> program. [80%]</p>
<p>The correctness part of your grade is broken down as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Category</th>
<th>Portion of grade</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Income taxes (problem 1)</td>
<td>20%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Day of year (problem 2)</td>
<td>30%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Adventure (problem 3)</td>
<td>30%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></li>
<li><p>Program design and style [20%]: style and program design will become increasingly important the more complex your program becomes. You should adhere to the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Variable names should be meaningful</li>
<li>Programs should contain at least a few descriptive comments to indicate to a reader what’s going on at a high level</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="challenge-problem">Challenge problem</h1>
<p>You may have noticed that the <code>hw3_doy.py</code> program does not handle user input that is not an integer. The challenge problem for this week is to take the <code>hw3_doy.py</code> program and update it to handle decimal inputs and report days to the nearest hour using am/pm. Here are two examples:</p>
<pre><code>Enter the day of the year: 4.41
Day 4.41 is January 4 at 10 am</code></pre>
<pre><code>Enter the day of the year: 38.712
Day 38.712 is February 7 at 5 pm</code></pre>
<p>If you intend to do the challenge problem, please make a copy of the <code>hw3_doy.py</code> program you will submit for problem #2 and rename it <code>hw3_challenge.py</code>. Make all challenge program edits to that file and NOT to your original <code>hw3_doy.py</code>.</p>
