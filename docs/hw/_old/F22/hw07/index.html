<h1 id="cosc-101-homework-7-spring-2022">COSC 101 Homework 7: Spring
2022</h1>
<p>Due date: <strong>Thursday, April 7, 5:00pm</strong></p>
<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The goal of this homework is to create a <em>well-designed</em> game
similar to <em>Wheel of Fortune</em>, where the computer picks a secret
word from a list, shuffles it, and the user guesses what the word is
letter by letter; however, the vowels are visible to the user this
time.</p>
<p>Please write your code in the template file <code>hw7_wheel.py</code>
included with this homework. Note that the file includes a function
(already written!) for drawing the scoreboard, a <code>main</code>
function for your program, a few helper functions
(<code>hide_consonants</code>, <code>shuffle_word</code>, and
<code>is_vowel</code>) and the start of a function called
<code>one_game</code>.</p>
<h2 id="required-functionality">Required functionality</h2>
<p>Here are the basic guidelines for how your program should behave:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The “scoreboard” that you draw will be in low-tech ASCII (just
letter, numbers and/or symbols). (We won’t be using Turtle or another
graphics package.) A function called <code>scoreboard</code> is provided
in the <code>hw7_wheel.py</code> template file. Given an integer
<code>misses</code> representing the number of missed guesses, it prints
the scoreboard and <code>misses</code> number of X’s.</p>
<p>There should be exactly <strong>seven</strong> missed guesses allowed
before declaring that a player has lost.</p></li>
<li><p>The first line in function <code>one_game</code> hides the
consonants in the secret word; the output is stored in the variable
<code>state,</code> which corresponds to the current state of guessing,
i.e., the game starts with the vowels visible; however, the letters are
not in the correct order.</p></li>
<li><p>Before you ask for a new letter to guess, you should display the
letters that have been previously guessed, and the current “state” of
guessing (variable <code>state</code>). For the current guess state, you
can display the actual letters that have been correctly guessed, and
underscores for letters that are yet to be guessed correctly. For
example, if the word is “SUNNY”, the secret word is “NYNSU” and the
player has correctly guessed the “N”, you should print something
like:</p>
<p><code>N _ N _ U</code></p>
<p>Note that the blanks are formed with underscore characters. Note also
that the output is rather nicely formatted.</p></li>
<li><p>Keeping track of the <em>guess state</em>, or information about
the word a user is trying to guess and which letters have been correctly
guessed is a key challenge for this homework. You can do this with the
variable <code>state</code> which can be updated with the following
steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When a valid guess is obtained, you can iterate through the
indexes of the secret word and employ an accumulator pattern to build
the new “guess state”. For each index, if the letter in the secret word
at that index is the same as the guess, concatenate the letter that was
guessed correctly, otherwise concatenate a <code>_</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that when you print out the guess state you will want to
print a space between each letter so that it is clear how many letters
are to be guessed. For example, if the secret word is
<code>PUMPKIN</code> and the player has correctly <code>P</code>, the
guess state should be <code>'P__P___'</code>. Instead of printing
<code>'P__P___'</code>, though, you should print
<code>'P _ _ P _ _ _'</code> (spaces between each letter/underscore). A
recipe for accomplishing this is (assuming a string variable named
<code>game_state</code> holds the game state):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="st">&#39; &#39;</span>.join(<span class="bu">list</span>(game_state)))</span></code></pre></div></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>A <code>main</code> function is also started in the
<code>hw7_wheel.py</code> template. The main function contains a list of
words; the <code>random.choice</code> function is used to randomly
select one of the words, which is then mixed to start the game. The list
of words can be modified.</p></li>
<li><p>Your program should just play one game of wheel of fortune. When
a game ends because of a win or a loss by the player, the program should
end.</p></li>
<li><p>When you ask for the next guess from a player, you should only
accept a single letter as a valid guess; all other inputs should be
treated as invalid. This behavior must be implemented in the function
<code>is_valid_guess</code>, it contains doctests that illustrate its
functionality. The program should not crash, an appropriate error
message should be shown, and the game should continue. <strong>Any
invalid guesses should <em>not</em> count against a
player</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>When you obtain a new valid guess (one letter), <strong>it is
strongly suggested that you convert any inputs to upper-case</strong>
for handling the rest of the game logic. Handling all strings in upper
case will simplify logic in your code.</p></li>
<li><p>Any duplicate guesses should <em>not</em> count against a player.
For example, if a player has already guessed “A” and they guess it
again, you should print a message like “You’ve already guessed A”, but
otherwise do nothing.</p></li>
<li><p>Once that you’re sure about how the game is played and you
understand the basic requirements listed above, you’ll need to think
carefully about how to design and implement the game in Python. Ensure
that all your functions are SOFA: that they are short, do one thing,
take few arguments, and are pitched at a consistent level of
abstraction. Moreover, make sure that your functions contain well-formed
docstrings and that you include comments next to portions of code that
need some further explanation.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="suggested-program-structure">Suggested program structure</h2>
<p>The design of the program to play <em>Wheel of Fortune</em> is up to
you, but here is a suggested structure. This is a <em>suggestion</em>;
if you deviate from it, that’s up to you, but for all functions you
write you should try to make sure that:</p>
<ul>
<li>any function you write does <em>one</em> thing (i.e., one specific
task);</li>
<li>any function function you write just takes parameters and returns a
return value (or return values), but does <em>not</em> modify any global
state or global variables;</li>
<li>any function you write is fairly <em>short</em>; it is possible to
write <em>all</em> the code to play a game in a single function but
that’s a bad design.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you go with the suggested structure below, a further strong
suggestion is to write a little bit of code at a time (one function at
most, but maybe just a couple lines in a function) and test as you go.
Writing most all the code you think you need and testing afterward is a
strategy that will often lead to frustration. Do a little bit at a
time.</p>
<h3 id="a-function-to-get-the-next-guess.">1. A function to get the next
guess.</h3>
<p>A key task in this game is to ask the user for their next guess (a
single letter). This function should repeatedly ask the user for their
guess until they type a single letter.</p>
<p>Some specific suggestions about this function:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a <code>while</code> loop for repeatedly asking the user for new
input until valid (one letter) input is given.<br />
</li>
<li>Don’t worry about whether the user has guessed a particular letter
before or not in this function.<br />
</li>
<li>Return the (valid) letter guessed as an <em>upper case</em> letter.
That way, you can just deal with upper-case letters and strings
elsewhere in the program which will simplify things a lot.</li>
</ul>
<p>An example function header might be:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">def</span> get_guess():</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="co">&quot;&quot;&quot;Get the next player guess.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="a-function-to-print-the-current-game-state.">2. A function to
print the current “game state”.</h3>
<p>There are three aspects to the game state:</p>
<ul>
<li>the number of “misses” (letter guesses that aren’t in the secret
word) a user has made — you need this number for calling the function to
print the scoreboard,</li>
<li>all the previous guesses made by the user, whether or not those
guesses were valid or not,</li>
<li>some representation of which letters have been correctly guessed and
which have not yet been guessed (the “guess state”) — see notes in the
section above about how you might consider storing the guess state.</li>
</ul>
<p>This function would print this information nicely to the screen (see
the game traces linked below for examples of how your output might
look). This function wouldn’t need to return anything.</p>
<p>An example function header might be:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">def</span> print_game_state(misses, previous_guesses, guess_state):</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="co">&quot;&quot;&quot;Print current state of the game.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span></span></code></pre></div>
<h3
id="a-function-to-take-a-valid-and-correct-guess-and-update-the-guessing-state.">3.
A function to take a valid and correct guess, and <em>update</em> the
guessing state.</h3>
<p>For this function, you would accept the secret word, the guessed
letter, and the current guess state, then update the guess state. The
doctests can help understand the functionality of this function.</p>
<p>An example function header might be:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">def</span> update_game_state(guess, state, secret):</span>

<h3
id="a-function-to-tie-together-the-other-functions-and-coordinate-playing-one-game-of-wheel-of-fortune.">4.
A function to tie together the other functions and coordinate playing
one game of wheel of fortune.</h3>
<p>If you have the above three functions written, a function called
<code>one_game</code> could tie everything together by doing the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Initialize the guess state, including a variable to hold the
number of misses, a string to hold previous (valid) guesses, and a
string to hold which letters have been correctly guessed.</p></li>
<li><p>Have a <code>while</code> loop that will execute as long as the
game is in progress; remember that the game ends when a player either
has 7 misses or correctly guesses the word.</p>
<ul>
<li>Within the <code>while</code> loop, you could first print the
current game state.</li>
<li>Next, you could ask for the next guess.</li>
<li>You could then handle the new guess by updating the guess state if
it had not been previously guessed and was a letter in the secret word,
otherwise you could handle the guess in another appropriate way.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>A function header for <code>one_game</code> could be as follows (this
is already written in the <code>hw7_wheel.py</code> template):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">def</span> one_game(word, secret):</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  <span class="co">&quot;&quot;&quot;Play one game of wheel of fortune.&quot;&quot;&quot;</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>  state <span class="op">=</span> hide_consonants(secret)  </span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="example-output">Example output</h2>
<p>The following pages demonstrate what a correctly working wheel of
fortune game should look like. Study these examples closely! Your code
must exhibit the same logic, but you are free to revise the particular
language used in the prompts to the user.</p>

</ul>
<h1 id="grading">Grading</h1>
<p>Your assignment will be graded on two criteria:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Correctness (75%): your wheel of fortune game must be implemented
correctly. Refer to the example output above to help ensure that your
program works the way it should.</p></li>
<li><p>Program design and style (25%): program design is particularly
important for this assignment. Organize your functions so that each one
is relatively short does <em>one</em> thing and takes few arguments.
Think about how to break down the problem of “playing wheel of fortune”
into smaller subtasks. And as usual:</p>
<ul>
<li>Functions should have meaningful docstrings</li>
<li>Variable names should be meaningful</li>
<li>Programs should contain at least a few descriptive comments. Do
<em>not</em> comment every line of code with low level explanations of
what each line does. Focus on high level ideas.</li>
<li>All code should be structured so that the logic is clear and easy to
follow.</li>
<li>There should be <em>no global variables</em>. Any information needed
inside a function should be passed as parameters; anything done by a
function that needs to be used by the caller of the function should be
returned from the function.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="testing">Testing</h1>
<p>There are no automated tests for this homework. You’ll need to run
your code and test it in a variety of ways to ensure that it behaves
according to the specifications above. You are strongly encouraged to
write <code>doctest</code> tests for your functions, but you are not

<p>There are two options for challenge problems for this homework, as
described below.</p>
<h2 id="challenge-problem-option-1-evil-wheel-of-fortune">Challenge
problem option 1: Evil Wheel of Fortune</h2>
<p>If you complete the Wheel of Fortune game as described, you can try
to complete this optional challenge problem. Modify the game to have an
“evil” option. Prompt the user to play evil or regular Wheel of Fortune.
If the user chooses to play evil Wheel of Fortune, then the computer
does something really sneaky: it avoids committing to a secret word for
as long as possible. (You’ll need to create a larger set of secret words
in order to make evil Wheel of Fortune truly evil.)</p>
<p>Here’s how it might work. The computer has a list of words to choose
from. Each time the user guesses a letter, the computer can tell the
user that the letter is not in the word, provided that the computer
still has some words left in its list that don’t have that letter. If
eventually every word in the evil computer player’s list has the guessed
letter, then the computer can finally commit to a word (by choosing one
at random). To get full credit, your evil player can cheat in this way
but must ultimately still play a game that appears to be fair. For
instance, at the end of the game, win or lose, the computer player must
expose its secret word. So, if the player guesses ‘a’ then ‘e’ then ‘o’
then ‘u’ then ‘i’ then ‘y’ and the computer says that none of those
letters are in the word, then the computer player is in trouble unless
it can come up with a word that has no vowels in it!</p>
<h2 id="challenge-problem-option-2-fancy-scoreboard">Challenge problem
option 2: Fancy scoreboard</h2>
<p>You’ll notice that the scoreboard printed by the
<code>scoreboard</code> function is pretty … bland. For this challenge
problem, you could design a new, fancier scoreboard to be printed as
part of game play. For example: you could use Emoji for some parts of
the scoreboard, or you could print some features in color. The design is
entirely up to you.</p>
<p>For printing Emoji, you will either need to copy/paste particular
emoji into your program, or (better) you can use the Unicode character
code for a particular symbol or emoji. To use a character code in
Python, you’ll need to first look up a symbol and its code equivalent;
you can do this using code charts available from unicode.org. There is a
page with <em>all</em> code charts (http://www.unicode.org/charts/), and
specific pages linked from that index show Emoticons
(https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F600.pdf), miscellaneous symbols
(https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2600.pdf) and more. For example,
the first Emoticon face on the Emoticons table
(https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F600.pdf) lists a character code
of 1F600. To use that code in Python, you need to prefix the code with
<code>'\U000'</code>, like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;</span><span class="ch">\U0001F600</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Any Unicode character code can be printed in that way. (Note that the
number of characters after <code>'\U'</code> must be 8, so if the
character code is only 4 characters, you need to prefix it with
<code>'\U0000'</code>.)</p>
<p>For printing text in color, you can refer to the following web page
for examples of using “ANSI Escape Codes”:
https://www.lihaoyi.com/post/BuildyourownCommandLinewithANSIescapecodes.html.
The first part of that page gives some guidance on emitting specific
special codes with <code>print</code> to cause text to be shown in
different colors.</p>
