<h1 id="cosc-101-homework-2-fall-2020">COSC 101 Homework 2: Fall 2020</h1>
<p>The due date for this homework is <strong>Friday, September 18, 5pm EDT</strong>. Upload your solutions to moodle.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This assignment is designed to give you a first introduction to writing programs in Python! By completing this assignment you will demonstrate that you understand a number of important concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to exchange input and output with the user using <code>input</code> and <code>print</code></li>
<li>how to work with multiple data types (<code>str</code>, <code>int</code>, and <code>float</code> types) and how to change types (e.g., from <code>str</code> to <code>float</code> and <code>float</code> to <code>int</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>We encourage you to start early.</p>
<h2 id="your-assignment">Your assignment</h2>
<p>Your task is to complete following steps:</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>Download the <a href="hw2.zip">hw2.zip</a> file from the course website and open it. You will see that it contains three python files: <code>hw2_currency.py</code>, <code>hw2_garden.py</code> and <code>hw2_roadtrip.py</code>. You are expected to write your programs in these files.</li>
<li>Complete program 1 (“Currency converter”) in the file called <code>hw2_currency.py</code>.</li>
<li>Complete program 2 (“Garden planner”) in the file called <code>hw2_garden.py</code>.</li>
<li>Complete program 3 (“Are we there yet?”) in the file called <code>hw2_roadtrip.py</code>.</li>
<li>(OPTIONAL) Use the testing program to help check your work.</li>
<li>Review the grading criteria at the end of this assignment.</li>
<li>(OPTIONAL) Do the challenge problem for this homework.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that each starter <code>.py</code> file has a header with some information for you to fill in. Please do so. Your feedback helps the instructors to understand better your experiences with doing the homeworks and where we can provide better assistance.</p>
<h3 id="program-1-currency-converter">Program 1: Currency converter</h3>
<p>For the first problem, you’ll write a program that converts a value in one currency to another. The program should prompt for the following information:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The name or abbreviation of the first currency (a string).</li>
<li>The name or abbreviation of the second currency (a string).</li>
<li>The exchange rate (as a floating point number).</li>
<li>The amount to convert (as a floating point number).</li>
</ol>
<p>The program should then compute the value in the new currency and print a statement about how much money</p>
<p>Here is an example showing how your program’s output should look:</p>
<pre><code>What is the first currency? GBP
What is the second currency? EUR
What is the exchange rate from GBP to EUR? 1.18
What is the amount to convert? 25
25.0 GBP is equivalent to 29.5 EUR</code></pre>
<p>Note that you do not need to round any of the amounts or worry about printing the currency amount with two decimal places. You also do not need to worry about invalid inputs (e.g., negative values or otherwise nonsensical values).</p>
<h3 id="program-2-garden-planner">Program 2: Garden planner</h3>
<p>For this problem, you will write a program to calculate the materials needed for an ornamental garden according to the design below. In this design, the blue areas represent flowerbeds and the yellow areas are filled with stone, mulch, or other fill material. The garden is a perfect square. The four outer flowerbeds are congruent semicircles and the central flowerbed is a perfect circle.</p>
<p><img src="garden.png" /></p>
<p>Your program should prompt the user for the following information:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The side length (in feet) of the finished garden.</p></li>
<li><p>The recommended spacing (in feet) between plants.</p></li>
<li><p>The depth (in feet) of the flowerbeds.</p></li>
<li><p>The depth (in feet) of the filled areas.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Next estimate the number of plants and the amount of fill and flowerbed soil needed. Recall that the formula for the area <em>A</em> of a circle is <em>A</em> = <span class="math inline"><em>π</em> * <em>r</em><sup>2</sup></span>, where <em>r</em> denotes the radius. For this calculation, you can simply use 3.14 as the value of π. (We will learn how to obtain a more precise value for π later in class.)</p>
<p>To estimate the number of plants for a flowerbed, divide the area of the flowerbed by the area needed per plant (the square of the recommended distance between plants) and then truncate this result. To truncate a float, convert it to an int using the <code>int()</code> function which implicitly truncates the float. But be careful: the number of plants in a semicircle may not be exactly half of the plants in a full circle.</p>
<p>Finally, it should report the following quantities needed for the garden:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Number of plants for each type of flowerbed (semicircle and circle) and total number of plants for the garden.</p></li>
<li><p>Cubic <strong>yards</strong> of soil for each type of flowerbed (semicircle and circle) and total cubic yards of soil for the garden, rounded to one decimal place (use the <code>round()</code> function). Note that there are 3 (linear) feet in 1 (linear) yard.</p></li>
<li><p>Total cubic <strong>yards</strong> of fill material for the garden, rounded to one decimal place (use the <code>round()</code> function). Again, note that there are 3 feet in 1 yard.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You may assume that the user only enters numbers. That is, you don’t need to do error checking for bad input.</p>
<p>Remember to convert fill to cubic yards.</p>
<p>Here is an outline of the program you’ll write in <code>hw2_garden.py</code>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Prompt for input (use <code>input()</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Convert the input strings to numbers (use <code>float()</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Do some mathematical calculations using the input numbers to get results. (See description above.)</p></li>
<li><p>Print the results (use <code>print()</code>)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Here are two examples of how the output of your program should look:</p>
<p><strong>Example output 1</strong></p>
<pre><code>Enter length of side of garden (feet): 10
Enter spacing between plants (feet): 0.5
Enter depth of garden soil (feet): 0.8333
Enter depth of fill (feet): 0.8333

Plants for each semicircle garden: 39
Plants for the circle garden: 78
Total plants for garden: 234
Soil for each semicircle garden: 0.3 cubic yards
Soil for the circle garden: 0.6 cubic yards
Total soil for the garden: 1.8 cubic yards
Total fill for the garden: 1.3 cubic yards</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example output 2:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Enter length of side of garden (feet): 13
Enter spacing between plants (feet): 0.25
Enter depth of garden soil (feet): 0.5
Enter depth of fill (feet): 0.25

Plants for each semicircle garden:  265
Plants for the circle garden:  530
Total plants for garden:  1590
Soil for each semicircle garden: 0.3 cubic yards
Soil for the circle garden: 0.6 cubic yards
Total soil for the garden:  1.8 cubic yards
Total fill for the garden: 0.6 cubic yards</code></pre>

<h3 id="program-3-are-we-there-yet">Program 3: Are we there yet?</h3>
<p>Road trip! Write a program that asks for a driver’s name, the distance (in miles) and the speed (in miles per hour) and reports how long it will take the driver to arrive at the destination. The time should be reported in units of days, hours, minutes, and seconds, rounded to the nearest second. The printed numbers should be of type <code>int</code>, however, you may need to work with floats during the computation.</p>
<p>Your program’s output should look like the examples provided below.</p>
<p>Here is an example execution where the user types “Jack” for the driver’s name, “3000” for the distance and “50” for the speed:</p>
<pre><code>Who is driving? Jack K.
How far away is the destination (in miles)? 3000
How fast is Jack K. driving (in mph)? 50
It will take Jack K. 2 days, 12 hours, 0 minutes, and 0 seconds.</code></pre>
<p>Another example. This time the user types “Ryan” for the driver’s name, “120” for the distance and “30” for the speed:</p>
<pre><code>Who is driving? Ryan
How far away is the destination (in miles)? 120
How fast is Ryan driving (in mph)? 30
It will take Ryan 0 days, 4 hours, 0 minutes, and 0 seconds.</code></pre>
<p>Here is another example. The driver is only going 3 miles but he’s going 120 mph, which is equivalent to 2 miles per minute! Going 3 miles takes one and a half minutes, but notice how the program breaks it down into minutes and seconds:</p>
<pre><code>Who is driving? Dwayne
How far away is the destination (in miles)? 3
How fast is Dwayne driving (in mph)? 120
It will take Dwayne 0 days, 0 hours, 1 minutes, and 30 seconds.</code></pre>
<p>One more example, where the driver is going a mile per minute. Notice how <span class="math inline">$\frac{3}{4}$</span> of a mile translates to 45 seconds, which is <span class="math inline">$\frac{3}{4}$</span> of a minute:</p>
<pre><code>Who is driving? Vin D.
How far away is the destination (in miles)? 45.75
How fast is Vin D. driving (in mph)? 60
It will take Vin D. 0 days, 0 hours, 45 minutes, and 45 seconds.</code></pre>
<p>Some important details and a few hints:</p>
<ul>
<li>The driver’s name is used in the subsequent prompt about driving speed.</li>
<li>One approach to solving this problem is to first figure out how long the trip will take in seconds. For example, to go 3000 miles at 50 mph will take 216,000 seconds! Given the total amount of time in seconds, break that number down into days, hours, minutes, and remaining seconds.</li>
<li>To round to the nearest whole number, use the <code>round</code> function. Although the <code>round</code> function does round off the fractional part, it returns a number of type <code>float</code> whereas you probably want an <code>int</code>. Remember that you can use the <code>int</code> function to get an <code>int</code> from a <code>float</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>For this homework, we are providing a program that you can use to test that your homework is meeting the basic specifications of the assignment.</p>
<p>Please note:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The test program is <strong>extremely</strong> picky about spacing in the output (from print statements) your program produces. If it reports an error, it might just be the difference of a single space.</p></li>
<li><p>The test program is <strong>NOT</strong> a complete test. You will still need to take responsibility for thoroughly testing your code before submitting. However, our hope is that this test program will at least catch minor errors and make it easier for our grading process and more likely for you to receive full credit.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To use the test program, follow these steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Find the test program that is inside the zip file for this homework. The file name is <code>hw2tester.py</code>. Make sure that this file is in <em>exactly</em> the same folder as the three homework files for this assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure your homework files are named exactly as described in assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>Open <code>hw2tester.py</code> in IDLE.</p></li>
<li><p>In IDLE, select <code>Run</code> -&gt; <code>Run module</code></p></li>
<li><p>Read the test messages that are printed and revise your work accordingly. If the output of your program does not precisely match the expected output, a test will fail. An HTML file (a web page) will be created to show the exact differences between what your program prints and the expected output; if output does not match, you will see a message such as <code>View a detailed output comparison in hw2_garden.py.html.</code> indicating the name of the file that you can open in your web browser.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We hope you find this helpful!</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Your assignment will be graded on two criteria:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Correctness: this document contains several examples for each program. Be sure that you run your program once for each example and make sure it works correctly for each one (run the <code>hw2tester.py</code> program, as described above)! [80%]</p>
<p>The correctness part of your grade is broken down as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Category</th>
<th>Portion of grade</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Currency converter</td>
<td>20%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Garden materials calculator</td>
<td>30%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Road trip</td>
<td>30%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></li>
<li><p>Program design and style [20%]: style and program design become increasingly important the more complex your program becomes. For these programs, adhere to the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Variable names should be meaningful</li>
<li>Programs should contain at least a few descriptive comments. Each of the programs for this homework involves multiple conceptual steps and should have comments that indicate to a reader what’s going on at a high level.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="challenge-problem">Challenge problem</h2>
<p>You may have noticed that the three programs for this homework ignore the fact that a user might enter invalid or nonsensical values. The challenge problem for this week is to take one of the three problems above and to handle invalid input by printing an error message and quitting the program.</p>
<p>If you intend to do the challenge problem, please make a copy of the program you are modifying and name it <code>hw2_challenge.py</code>. Make any challenge problem edits to that file and <em>not</em> to the original homework file.</p>
