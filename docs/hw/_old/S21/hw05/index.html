<h1 id="cosc-101-homework-5-spring-2021">COSC 101 Homework 5: Spring 2021</h1>
<p>The due date for this homework is <strong>Thursday, March 11, 5:00pm EDT</strong>.</p>
<p>This homework will improve your skills with functions and the doctest module. Specifically, this assignment is designed to give you practice with the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing short functions that are conducive to unit testing</li>
<li>Using the <code>doctest</code> module to write unit tests</li>
</ul>
<p>As usual, we encourage you to start early.</p>
<h1 id="design-your-own-homework">“Design Your Own Homework”</h1>
<p>For this homework, you will use the Python skills you’ve acquired so far to create a program that solves <em>any</em> problem within reason. You are free to be as creative as you like in choosing a problem and devising a program to solve it. You are also <em>strongly encouraged</em> (but not required) to work with a partner. Programming collaboratively is an important skill and one that is worth practicing.</p>
<p>There are only a few requirements:</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li><p>Your choice of program should be of roughly similar difficulty to the most recent homework assignments (i.e., doable within 1 week and enough to do for 1 week).</p></li>
<li><p>Your program <em>must</em> be divided up into functions, and <strong>at least two</strong> of those functions must have doctests with 3 or more examples. There are examples below of how to use doctest; you can also refer to your class notes.</p></li>
<li><p>Your group must complete and submit your code by Thursday, March 11 at 5pm. Along with your code, you must also submit a description of the code to explain (a) what the program is, (b) why you chose to do what you did, and (c) a (very) brief description of how to run the program. The writeup does not need to be long (please keep it relatively short!)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If your group is having a hard time coming up with a program to write, please let your instructor know; they can suggest a few ideas if you are really stuck on what to do.</p>
<p>Because of the nature of this assignment there is no challenge problem for this week.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-doctest-module">Using the <code>doctest</code> module</h2>
<p>The <code>doctest</code> module allows you to write tests for individual functions within the docstring of a function. At least two of the functions in your program must have at least three doctest examples in them. Here’s an example of a function <code>isprime</code> that has three doctest examples:</p>
<pre><code>import doctest

def isprime(n):
    &#39;&#39;&#39;
    check if n is prime; return True if so, False otherwise.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; isprime(2)
    True
    &gt;&gt;&gt; isprime(7)
    True
    &gt;&gt;&gt; isprime(10)
    False
    &#39;&#39;&#39;
    if n &lt; 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, n):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod(verbose=True)</code></pre>
<p>When you run this program, the output shows that the doctest module finds each of the three test case examples, runs them, and checks that the return value is as expected:</p>
<pre><code>Trying:
    isprime(2)
Expecting:
    True
ok
Trying:
    isprime(7)
Expecting:
    True
ok
Trying:
    isprime(10)
Expecting:
    False
ok
1 items had no tests:
    __main__
1 items passed all tests:
   3 tests in __main__.isprime
3 tests in 2 items.
3 passed and 0 failed.
Test passed.</code></pre>
<p>You can find more information in the Python documentation on doctest: <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html">https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html</a>.</p>
<h1 id="submission-instructions">Submission Instructions</h1>
<p>Please submit a <code>.py</code> file with your code in it. Indicate in comments at the top of the program who worked on it and how long you spent. Please remember to cite anyone from whom you received help, or any other sources of help (e.g., websites).</p>
<p>You must also submit the description of your code with parts a–c above. This description must be submitted as a <code>.txt</code> plaintext file.</p>
<h1 id="grading">Grading</h1>
<p>Your assignment will be graded on three criteria:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Correctness: there is no predefined notion of “correctness” for this assignment, but your program should work for all reasonable inputs, given whatever your program is intended to do. You must also have at least two functions that have doctests. Each of those functions must have at least 3 test examples. [80%]</p>
<p>The correctness part of your grade is broken down as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Category</th>
<th>Portion of grade</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Code correctness</td>
<td>40%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Doctests for two functions</td>
<td>30%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></li>
<li><p>Code description [10%] including</p>
<ul>
<li><p>what the program is</p></li>
<li><p>why you chose to do what you did</p></li>
<li><p>how to run the program</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Program design and style [20%]: style and program design become increasingly important the more complex your program becomes. For these programs, adhere to the following guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Variable names should be meaningful</p></li>
<li><p>Programs should contain at least a few descriptive comments. Do <em>not</em> comment every line of code with low level explanations of what each line does. Focus on high level ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>Programs should be <em>modular</em>, i.e. divided into several smaller functions to avoid code reuse and support unit testing.</p></li>
<li><p>All functions must have docstrings that give a brief description of what they do.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
