title: COSC 101&#58; Exam 3
---


## Concepts covered

The third midterm exam covers everything up through (but not including) dictionaries. The exam is *cumulative*.

The *new* concepts since the last exam include:

 - string slicing and string methods
 - lists and list aliasing
 - file I/O
 - exceptions
 
## Study tips

 - **Do practice problems.**

 - Write out your answer on paper (computers are not permitted during the exam!) Once you have an answer, test it by tracing your code by hand. Then you may find it useful to type it into a computer and run it in IDLE or Python Tutor's Visualize.

 - Avoid looking at the solutions until you've spent at least 15-30 minutes trying to solve the problem on your own.


## Study materials

 - Problems from class (slides, handouts, etc.)

 - Exercises from readings
