title: COSC 101&#58; Final Exam
---

<!-- The final exam is administered during the scheduled period for your class section as specified by the university exam schedule.  Please refer to information from your instructor for the most complete information.  Note that calculators, notes, and computers are not permitted for the exam. -->

The final exam is two hours long. The exam will be similar in format to the previous exams and on Moodle.  It will be available to take during final exam week (specific times of availability TBD).

## Concepts covered

The final exam is *cumulative* and encompasses all topics covered by earlier exams.

The *new* concepts since the last exam include:

  - dictionaries
  - use of data structures (list, dictionaries) in different types of problems
  - program design (emphasized more on the final)
  - recursion

<!-- classes and objects, (recursive web crawling, random surfer simulations, etc.). -->


## Study tips

- **Do practice problems.**
- Write out your answer on paper (computers are not permitted during the exam!)
- Avoid looking at the solutions until you've spent at least 15-30 minutes trying to write the solution on your own.
- Try to talk through your code with a friend.  Don't just say "here's a while loop"; instead, explain what the code is trying to do.  The more you can talk through your approach to a problem, the easier it will be to write code that implements that approach.

## Study materials

- Problems from class (slides, handouts, quizzes, etc.)
- Problems from each section read from the textbook
- Practice problems from the previous exams ([exam 1](../exam1), [exam 2](../exam2)
- Additional practice [problems](practice_problems) and [solutions](practice_solutions) 
- [Random expression generator](https://www.cs.colgate.edu/~jsommers/cgi-bin/cosc101expr.php)
- Previous Exams

<!-- Note: codingbat does not have any recursion problems for python, but it does have a nice collection for Java. You can read those problem descriptions and still try to solve them (in python of course). They can be found here: [java coding bat](http://codingbat.com/java/Recursion-1)-->
