---


## Concepts covered

The first exam covers chapters 1-5, 6.1-6.2, and 7, including the following topics:

- Types (`int`, `str`, `float`, `bool`)
- Expressions, variables, and assignment
- Interactive programs (`input`, `print`)
- Repetition with definite loops (`for`)
- Accumulator pattern
- Conditional statements (`if`/`elif`/`else`)
- String indexing and basic operations (`+`, `*`, `len`)
- Functions (including parameters and return values


## Study tips

- **Do practice problems.**
- Write out your answer on paper (computers are not permitted during the exam!)
- Avoid looking at the solutions until you've spent at least 15-30 minutes trying to write the solution on your own.


## Practice problems

**Note**: the two practice exams below contain some good example problems to work through.  The format of the exam on Moodle will differ somewhat from these example exams; they are primarily posted here to provide some additional practice problems for study.

- [Practice Exam 1](practice-exam1_blank.pdf)
- [Practice Exam 1 w/solutions](practice-exam1_solutions.pdf)
- [Practice Exam 2](2019-Spring-exam1-blank.pdf)
- [Practice Exam 2 w/solutions](2019-Spring-exam1-solution.pdf)
- [Practice Problems](practice_problems)
- [Practice Problem Solutions](practice_solutions)

Besides the problems above, you can also get additional practice with Python expressions with this [expression generator](https://www.cs.colgate.edu/~jsommers/cgi-bin/cosc101expr.php?int=0&float=0&bool=0) web page.
