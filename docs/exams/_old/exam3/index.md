title: COSC 101&#58; Exam 3
---


## Concepts covered

The third midterm exam covers everything up through (but not including) dictionaries. The exam is *cumulative*.

The *new* concepts since the last exam include:

 - lists and list aliasing
 - file I/O
 
This is the first exam on Moodle. See your section's Moodle page for a practice exam demonstrating the format of problems you will see on the exam.

## Study tips

 - **Do practice problems.**

 - Write out your answer on paper (computers are not permitted during the exam!) Once you have an answer, test it by tracing your code by hand. Then you may find it useful to type it into a computer and run it in IDLE or Python Tutor's Visualize.

 - Avoid looking at the solutions until you've spent at least 15-30 minutes trying to solve the problem on your own.


## Study materials

 - Problems from class (slides, handouts, etc.)

 - Exercises from readings
 
 - Python [coding bat](https://codingbat.com/python).  There are many good exercises on this site.  Not all topics covered in class are addressed in problems at this site, but there are many good problems to work on.
