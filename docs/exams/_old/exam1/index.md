## Concepts covered

The first prelim exam covers chapters 1-5 and 7, including the following topics:

- Types (`int`, `str`, `float`, `bool`)
- Expressions, variables, and assignment
- Interactive programs (`input`, `print`)
- Repetition with definite loops (`for`)
- Accumulator pattern
- Conditional statements (`if`/`elif`/`else`)


## Study tips

- **Do practice problems.**
- Write out your answer on paper (computers are not permitted during the exam!)
- Avoid looking at the solutions until you've spent at least 15-30 minutes trying to write the solution on your own.
